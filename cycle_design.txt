Meeting 6/16
Members Present: Ashley, Hailey

TODO: Split responsibilities, grouping similar classes together, even workload

** Not exactly sure how the Collision Handler, Hitbox, Grid, and Point classes should interact, there seems to be some overlapping functions there. Like a Hitbox could just be a grid item/Point. Also it seems a bit more complicated than it needs to be, since the GUI only works on a Point based system, where it needs an integer between the 0 and the MAX WINDOW size.

Groups:
- Director, Collision Handler, Hitbox, Cast (hard)
    - Director calls other classes and runs the game
    - Making sure the collisions are handled correctly
        - Collision Handler will check if the Player hitboxes overlap eachother OR can check if Player Point position is within the other Player's Hitbox
    - The Cast of the two Players/Cycles
        - Cast will update the Players (Director will only do self._cast.update() instead of having to move each Player)
- Window/Graphical Interface, Color (medium)
    - The Window that displays everything
    - New Method for display Message, use getters instead of assuming location
    - Color will be its own class, see professor's example
- Actor, Player/Cycle, Player_Input, Key_Set, Trail_Piece (hard)
    - Making sure Actor (base) and child classes of Player/Cycle and Trail Piece work
    - Player_Input is given a Key_Set from Player to use (in the __init__ for Player, self._keyboard_interface = Keyboard_Interface(self._key_set))
    - Key_Set will be different for Player 1 and 2 (director will pass key_set to Player, have parameters for Player in the __init__ method) --> so something like Player(Actor): def __init__(self, key_set) + the other variables needed
- Message, Score (easy)
    - Adjust Score to inherit from message (message = {points} <-- updates) 
    - Message will also be used for Game Over (just have message = "Game Over" <-- constant)
- Grid, Point (easy-medium)
    - Set up a grid for everything to work on (See how GUI works and see professor's example)
        - Works on a grid instead of a point system (!!! Will have to work with the Hitbox/Collison Handler class - Hitbox could be a grid 'box', check if items are on the same gridbox/aiming to enter the same grid box)
    - Point/grid spots
        - Player positions will be stored as a Point instead of the simple [x, y] so there can be an additional class

TODO: Figure out more base classes
    - Actor (xy positions, xy velocity, symbol, color, etc)
    - Message (text, position, font size, color, etc)

Question:
    Player/Cycle and the Trail (children classes)
        - same method move() that is an override method, overrides the empty Actor's move method
        - differently used (trail follows the player, while the player gets player_input)

Actor (base)
    - virutal method, can be overridden
    - move(self): 
        return notimplementederror

Classes (16!)

(setup)
Class name
What it does:
Inherits from:
Attributes, things it has:
    - 
Methods, things it does:
    - 

- - - - -
(Main/base classes, used in all the programs)

Director 1
In charge of directing the game
(doesn't inherit)
Attribtues:
    - Game over
    - Cast (which is only the two players)
Methods:
    - Start game
    - Update
    - End game

Cast 2
Attribtues:
    - Player 1
    - Player 2 (change the starging location and the score's position)
Methods:
    - create player/actor

--> split the director class into smaller classes

Collision handler 12
TODO: New collision handler per collision
OR one collision handler, just does the methods/math calculations
Attribtues:
    - 
Methods:
    - Calculate hitbox range (figures out where the edges are )
    - If objects are colliding

Move Actors 13
Attribtues:
    - Cast
Methods:
    - Moves all the actors within the cast 

Message 14
Attributes:
    - The text to display
    - location to display it
Methods:
    - getter (so the GUI can know what to write and where)
        - The GUI needs Message, x_pos, y_pos

Graphic Interface/GUI - Window 3
In charge of visually showing whats going on
(doesn't inherit) import pyray
Attributes:
    - width
    - height
    - Frames per second
Methods:
    - 

Point (previously using [x, y]) 4
Attributes:
    - x coordinate
    - y coordinate
Does:
    - Lots of methods (see professor's)
        - Equals
        - Get x
        - Get y

Color (previously pyray.colors) 5
Attributes:
    - color rbg
Does:

Actor
(base class)
Attributes:
    - [x,y] position
    - velocity

Score 6
(Can inherit from Message - inherits text/message, position to display, etc) 
imported into the Player/Cycle class
Attributes:
    - int score
Methods:
    - Add points

Grid 7
Attributes:
    - [x,y] position on the screen (translates the position to grid spot)
    - 

Player Interface 8
Attributes:
    - Key_set
Methods:
    - get direction
        - pyray.is_key_down(key_set.get_up_key())


-   -   -   -   -
(Unique to the Cycle game (basically the snake game))


Key_set 9
Attribtues:
    - Up_key - W or I
    - Down_key
    - Left_key
    - Right_key

Methods:
    - get_up_key (return self._up_key)
    ... getter for each one

Player --> Cycle 10
# --> @#####
Inherits from Actor
Initialized parameters:
    - key_set
Attribtues:
    - Player's symbol ""
    - trail_pieces = []
    - Score
    - Player Interface 
        - Player 1 - key_set(WASD)
        - Player 2 - key_set(IJKL)
Methods:
    - add_trail_piece() (called when )

        - at the end of the method, moves each trail peice


Tail_pieces/Trail 11
Inherits from Actor
Attributes:
    - overrite symbol/color
Methods:
    - move --> changes so it following the cycle & its' movement
